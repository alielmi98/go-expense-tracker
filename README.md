# go-expense-tracker
 This API allows users to manage their expenses with features like user authentication, JWT-based session management, and expense tracking. Users can create, read, update, and delete their expenses, with options to filter by time periods, including the past week, month, or custom date ranges. Built with Go, it uses a flexible data model to categorize expenses.
